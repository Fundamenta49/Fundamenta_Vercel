# Zombie Fundi Components Backup

**IMPORTANT: These components can be permanently deleted after April 18, 2025 (48 hours) if no negative impacts are observed.**

## Components Removed
The following components were identified as potential zombie code (not imported or used anywhere):

1. `fundi-avatar-new.tsx`
2. `fundi-avatar.tsx`
3. `fundi-interactive-assistant.tsx`
4. `robot-fundi-enhanced.tsx`
5. `simple-button-fundi.tsx`
6. `simple-fundi.tsx`

## Verification Performed
- Analyzed import statements throughout the codebase
- Confirmed none of these components are used in tour functionality
- Verified the actively used Fundi components are preserved:
  - `fundi-avatar-enhanced.tsx`
  - `fundi-personality-adapter.tsx`
  - `robot-fundi-new.tsx`
  - `robot-fundi.tsx`
  - `fundi-interactions-service.ts`

## Restoration Process
If any issues arise, restore the components by copying them back to their original location in `client/src/components/`.

## Zombie Code Detection
These components were detected using our custom script:
`scan-fundi-components.sh`
