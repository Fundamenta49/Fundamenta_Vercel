PHASE 5A – Jungle Cleanup and Legacy Page Deprecation

MISSION OBJECTIVE:
Remove outdated jungle-themed pages and finalize /jungle-hub as the sole user entry point for the expedition experience. Clean up any routing conflicts, duplicate UI elements, or legacy components that could confuse users or introduce styling regressions.

---

TARGET PAGES TO REMOVE:
1. /learning/jungle-pathways.tsx
2. /learning/jungle-demo.tsx (if it exists)
3. Any jungle-themed tab or navigation legacy component that duplicates /jungle-hub functionality

---

STEP 1: REMOVE FILES

- Delete or archive the following:
  - `client/src/pages/learning/jungle-pathways.tsx`
  - `client/src/pages/learning/jungle-demo.tsx` (if still present)
  - Any old `JungleTabs` code if not in use anywhere else

---

STEP 2: REDIRECT BROKEN ROUTES

- In your `App.tsx` or equivalent routing file:
  - Add a redirect from `/learning/jungle-pathways` → `/jungle-hub`
  - Use `<Redirect>` or `<Navigate>` depending on your routing system

---

STEP 3: REMOVE "New Expedition Hub" BUTTON

- Go to the old jungle pathway page if it's still being rendered
- Remove any button pointing to `/jungle-hub` like:
  - “New Expedition Hub”
  - “Try the new experience”
- This is no longer needed once the legacy page is removed

---

STEP 4: VALIDATE `/JUNGLE-HUB` ROUTE

- Ensure all internal navigation now points only to `/jungle-hub`
- Remove any hardcoded navigation from other routes that reference deprecated pages

---

STEP 5: QA CHECK

- Test routes: `/jungle-hub`, `/zone/:id`, `/basecamp`, `/learning-hub`
- Confirm all jungle interactions now begin from `/jungle-hub`
- No duplicate jungle Fundi instances should be present

---

PHASE COMPLETE WHEN:
- Legacy pages are fully removed
- `/jungle-hub` is the default and only expedition entry point
- All links to old jungle routes redirect or are scrubbed
- Navigation is clean and scoped

---

DO NOT:
- Delete `/jungle-hub`
- Alter Fundi logic yet (this happens in Phase 5C)
- Remove zone-related data
