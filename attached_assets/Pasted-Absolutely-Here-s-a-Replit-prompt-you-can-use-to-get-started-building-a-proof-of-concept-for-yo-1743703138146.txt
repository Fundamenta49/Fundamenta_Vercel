### 🛠️ Replit Prompt – "AI Repair Assistant"

**Project Title:** `AI Repair Assistant MVP`

**Prompt:**

> Build a simple web app where a user can upload or take a photo of a broken object. The app uses AI to:
> 1. Analyze the image and identify the object and possible issue.
> 2. Provide a repair solution or diagnostic description.
> 3. Suggest a list of required parts.
> 4. Show estimated part prices from nearby stores (use dummy data or a free store API like Best Buy’s, Home Depot, or Lowe’s if available).

### 💡 Key Features to Include:
- **Image Upload / Webcam Capture**
- **AI Image Analysis (use a mock model or placeholder first)**
- **Repair Diagnosis Output (text)**
- **Parts List Generation (static list or based on item)**
- **Pricing Suggestions (using placeholder data or a free API)**

### 🧰 Stack Suggestions:
- **Frontend:** React (or simple HTML/CSS/JS)
- **Backend:** Flask or Node.js (if needed for image processing)
- **AI Integration:** Use placeholder logic or integrate with OpenAI's Vision API or a pre-trained object detection model like `YOLO` or `Google Cloud Vision`
- **Store API (Optional for MVP):**
  - [Best Buy API](https://developer.bestbuy.com/)
  - [Walmart API](https://developer.walmart.com/)
  - [Home Depot unofficial APIs / scraping]

### Example Flow:
1. **User uploads image →**
2. **App detects object: “Blender”**
3. **AI diagnosis: “Motor likely burnt out due to overheating.”**
4. **Suggested fix: “Replace motor unit”**
5. **Parts list:**
   - Replacement Motor ($12.99)
   - Thermal paste ($2.50)
6. **Nearby store links or placeholder prices**
