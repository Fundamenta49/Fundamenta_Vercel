PHASE 2: Agent Prompt – Hub Pages Implementation

MISSION OBJECTIVE:
Integrate the new ZoneCard navigation system into the live Fundamenta platform, replacing the old tab-based interface for both jungle-themed and standard learning paths. Build two themed landing pages—/jungle-hub and /learning-hub—that serve as the new user entry points into their learning journey.

---

STEP 1: Create Hub Pages

Create two new files:
- client/src/pages/jungle-hub.tsx
- client/src/pages/learning-hub.tsx

Import:
import { learningZones } from '@/data/zones-config';
import { ZoneCard } from '@/components/ZoneCard';
import { useUserProfile } from '@/hooks/useUserProfile'; // or appropriate user context

---

STEP 2: Render ZoneCards

In both pages:
- Fetch the user's current rank (e.g., userProfile.rank)
- Map over the learningZones array
- Render a ZoneCard for each zone:

Example JSX:
<ZoneCard
  key={zone.id}
  zone={zone}
  theme="jungle" // or "standard"
  userRank={userRank}
  onClick={(zoneId) => router.push(`/zone/${zoneId}?theme=jungle`)} // adjust as needed
/>

---

STEP 3: Themed Layout

Use responsive grid layout:
- 2-column grid on desktop
- Stacked layout on mobile

Add a top header with Fundi or themed copy:
- Jungle Hub: “Choose your next expedition, explorer!”
- Standard Hub: “Select a life skill path to continue.”

---

STEP 4: Replace Existing Navigation

In jungle-pathways.tsx and any file using JungleTabs or legacy tabs:
- Remove or comment out the JungleTabs/tab-based nav
- Add a button or direct route to /jungle-hub or /learning-hub

Ensure user flow now begins with the new hub pages.

---

STEP 5: Route Integration

Ensure clicking a ZoneCard routes to /zone/:zoneId
- Pass theme via query param or context (e.g., ?theme=jungle)
- Do not hardcode logic based on file path

---

PHASE COMPLETE WHEN:
- Both hub pages are live and working
- Tab bar has been replaced with ZoneCard-based hub navigation
- Locked zones display appropriately and block interaction
- Clicking an unlocked zone correctly routes the user to its module list
