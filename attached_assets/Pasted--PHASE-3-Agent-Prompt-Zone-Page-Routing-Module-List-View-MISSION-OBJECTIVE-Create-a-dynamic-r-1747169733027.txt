PHASE 3: Agent Prompt â€“ Zone Page Routing + Module List View

MISSION OBJECTIVE:
Create a dynamic route that loads a detailed zone page when the user selects a ZoneCard. This page should render the zone title, description, module list, and progress information. It must support both Jungle and Standard themes, using the context system already implemented in Phase 2 enhancements.

---

STEP 1: Create Dynamic Route Page

Create a new file:
- client/src/pages/zone/[zoneId].tsx

Use dynamic routing to load based on the zoneId extracted from the URL.

---

STEP 2: Use Zone and Theme Context

In the new zone page:
- Import and use `learningZones` from zones-config
- Use `useParams()` from Wouter (or your router) to extract zoneId
- Find the corresponding zone data from `learningZones`
- Use `LearningThemeProvider` to wrap the page and inject the correct theme
  - Infer theme from query param (?theme=jungle) or fallback to "standard"

---

STEP 3: Render Zone Page Layout

Inside the page:
- Use `HubLayout` or a new layout like `ZoneLayout` (if needed)
- Display:
  - Zone title and description (based on theme)
  - Zone icon and themeColor for visual styling
  - Progress bar or XP if available (optional for now)
  - Module list with jungle/standard names

---

STEP 4: List Modules

Each zone should display its modules, using data from `pathways-data.ts`:
- Filter modules by zone/category
- Display module title, jungle or standard variant depending on theme
- Optional: Show status (Not Started / In Progress / Completed)

---

STEP 5: Add Navigation + Fallback Handling

- Add "Back to Hub" button (return to jungle-hub or learning-hub based on theme)
- Handle case where zoneId is invalid with a 404-style fallback

---

PHASE COMPLETE WHEN:
- Visiting /zone/finance?theme=jungle loads Golden Temple with jungle modules
- Visiting /zone/wellness?theme=standard loads Wellness with standard modules
- Module list shows correct titles based on theme
- Page is wrapped in proper theme provider
- Navigation works cleanly and gracefully degrades if zone not found
