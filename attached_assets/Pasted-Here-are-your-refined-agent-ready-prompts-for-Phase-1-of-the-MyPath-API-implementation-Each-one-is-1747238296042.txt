Here are your refined, agent-ready prompts for Phase 1 of the MyPath API implementation. Each one is scoped and phrased clearly for a Replit agent to execute efficiently.

⸻

REPLIT AGENT PROMPT 1: Create POST /api/pathways Endpoint

Please create a backend API route at POST /api/pathways.
This route should:

	•	Accept the following in the request body: title, description, category, and isPublic
	•	Use session or JWT to extract createdBy (user ID)
	•	Validate the inputs using Zod
	•	Store the data in the custom_pathways table
	•	Return the saved pathway as JSON

Ensure the route is protected and returns appropriate error messages for invalid input or unauthenticated users.

⸻

REPLIT AGENT PROMPT 2: Create GET /api/pathways Endpoint

Add a GET /api/pathways route to return all custom pathways created by the current user.
Use the session or JWT to determine the user ID.
Query the database for all pathways where createdBy matches the current user.
Sort the results by creation date (most recent first).
Return the list of pathways as JSON.

Add basic error handling and ensure only the logged-in user’s pathways are returned.

⸻

REPLIT AGENT PROMPT 3: Create POST /api/modules Endpoint

Create a route at POST /api/modules for creating new learning modules.
It should:

	•	Accept pathwayId, title, content, and order in the request body
	•	Validate these fields using Zod
	•	Ensure the current user owns the pathway (check createdBy)
	•	Save the module to a custom_modules table
	•	Return the saved module as JSON

Only allow module creation for pathways the user owns. Return errors for missing or invalid fields.

⸻

REPLIT AGENT PROMPT 4: Create GET /api/modules/:pathwayId Endpoint

Create a GET /api/modules/:pathwayId route to fetch all modules for a specific pathway.
This route should:

	•	Validate the pathwayId parameter
	•	Check that the current user owns the pathway
	•	Query all modules where pathwayId matches
	•	Sort modules by the order field (ascending)
	•	Return them as a list of id, title, and content

Add error handling for unauthorized access or invalid IDs.

⸻

REPLIT AGENT PROMPT 5: Connect Frontend to Pathway & Module APIs

Please update the PathwayBuilder component to use the new backend APIs:

	1.	Use POST /api/pathways to create pathways
	2.	Use GET /api/pathways to list user pathways
	3.	Use POST /api/modules to add modules
	4.	Use GET /api/modules/:pathwayId to display modules

Use React Query or simple fetch() as needed.
Add loading spinners and error messages in the UI.
Replace any placeholder data with real data from the API.
