PHASE 4B – Expedition Hub Style Update Prompt

MISSION OBJECTIVE:
Update the visual design of the jungle-themed Expedition Hub (/jungle-hub) to match the polished interface shown in the approved image. This involves applying new Tailwind-based styling to the ZoneCard component, iconography, and button treatments while preserving theme logic and dynamic rank-based behavior.

---

TARGET COMPONENT:
- ZoneCard (client/src/components/unified/ZoneCard.tsx)

---

STEP 1: CARD CONTAINER STYLING

If `theme === 'jungle'`, apply the following classes to the root Card:
- Rounded corners
- Solid border with gold tone (#E6B933)
- Background: dark jungle green (`bg-[#16382F]`)
- Padding: medium with vertical breathing room

Example class set:
`"rounded-lg border border-[#E6B933] bg-[#16382F] text-white shadow-md hover:shadow-lg transition-all"`

---

STEP 2: ICON ENHANCEMENT PER ZONE

For each zone, replace the default icon with a visual-themed alternative. These can be SVG or Lucide-based. Add a large icon above the title or alongside it, depending on layout.

Suggestions:
- Golden Temple → `MountainIcon`
- Healing Springs → `DropletIcon` or `SpringIcon`
- Rugged Peaks → `TriangleIcon` or `ClimbIcon`
- Ancient Library → `BookOpenIcon`

Use inline icons with consistent sizing: `className="h-6 w-6 text-amber-400"`

---

STEP 3: TITLE AND TEXT TYPOGRAPHY

For jungle theme:
- Use `text-xl font-semibold` for the zone title
- Use `text-slate-300` or `text-white/80` for the description
- Add `tracking-wide` to title for jungle flavor

---

STEP 4: CATEGORY BADGE STYLING

Update the Finance / Wellness / etc. badges to have:
- Rounded-full badge with custom jungle tones
- Tailwind class example:
`"bg-amber-900 text-amber-200 px-3 py-0.5 text-sm font-medium rounded-full"`

Make sure the color shifts depending on the zone (optional: create a mapping of category => color).

---

STEP 5: BUTTON STYLE FOR “Explore” and “Unlock at Rank X”

- “Explore” button:
  - White text on gold outline: `text-[#E6B933] border border-[#E6B933] rounded-md px-4 py-1 font-semibold hover:bg-[#E6B933]/10`

- “Unlock” state:
  - Grayed out with lock icon
  - Use `opacity-50 pointer-events-none`
  - Optional: add tooltip or hint for how to unlock

---

STEP 6: GLOBAL CLEANUP

Ensure:
- No legacy card classes bleed into jungle mode
- Theme fallback to standard remains intact
- Only apply new styles if `theme === 'jungle'`

---

PHASE COMPLETE WHEN:
- `/jungle-hub` fully reflects the new jungle expedition design
- ZoneCards show bold icons, jungle badges, and explore buttons
- Locked cards are visually distinct
- UX matches the mockup screenshot

---

This is a style refactor only—do not change functional routing or behavior logic.
