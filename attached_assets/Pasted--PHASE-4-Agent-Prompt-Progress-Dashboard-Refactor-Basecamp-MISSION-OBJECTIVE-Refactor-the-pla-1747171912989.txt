PHASE 4: Agent Prompt – Progress Dashboard Refactor (Basecamp)

MISSION OBJECTIVE:
Refactor the platform’s progress tracking UX by moving completed module and XP information into a centralized progress dashboard. This new dashboard, called “Basecamp,” will allow users to review their achievements, track learning streaks, and re-enter modules. This page should work for both Jungle and Standard themes using the existing LearningThemeContext.

---

STEP 1: Create the Progress Dashboard Page

Create a new page:
- client/src/pages/basecamp.tsx

This page should:
- Display the user’s current XP and rank
- List all completed modules grouped by zone
- Include a “Resume Learning” section (optional: show last active module)

---

STEP 2: Create a BasecampLayout Component (Optional)

Create:
- client/src/components/layouts/BasecampLayout.tsx

Props:
interface BasecampLayoutProps {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  children: React.ReactNode;
}

Use theme-aware styling via useTheme(), just like HubLayout.

---

STEP 3: Display Completed Modules

Use the existing data from learningPathways and filter:
- Display only modules where module.completed === true
- Group by zone.category or zone.title
- Use ModuleCard or a new, smaller SummaryCard component

Each card should link back to the module or show completion date.

---

STEP 4: Show XP and Rank Progress

At the top of the Basecamp page:
- Display user XP and rank visually
- Optional: Add progress bar to next rank

---

STEP 5: Add Navigation Link to Basecamp

In both jungle-hub.tsx and learning-hub.tsx:
- Add a button in the top right that links to /basecamp
- Label: “Go to Basecamp” or “View Progress”

---

STEP 6: Theme Integration

Ensure Basecamp uses LearningThemeContext:
- Jungle: show XP bar in gold, jungle visuals
- Standard: clean UI with neutral visuals
- Theme should apply to both progress indicators and module summaries

---

PHASE COMPLETE WHEN:
- /basecamp is accessible and themed
- Completed modules are displayed by zone
- XP and rank are clearly shown
- Button from hub pages links to the Basecamp
- The system uses existing context and avoids code duplication
