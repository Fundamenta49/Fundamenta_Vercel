# REPLIT AGENT DIRECTIVE — EXPEDITIONCARD CONSOLIDATION

## Objective:
Consolidate all versions of `ExpeditionCard` into a single reusable component that supports multiple theme variants (`'jungle'`, `'standard'`, etc.), maintains progress consistency, and ensures scalable styling.

---

## ✅ AUTHORIZED ACTIONS:

### 1. Consolidate Files
- Merge all instances of `ExpeditionCard` found in:
  - `client/src/jungle-path/components/ExpeditionCard.tsx`
  - `client/src/components/standard/expedition-card.tsx` (if it exists)
- Create a final version at:
  ```
  client/src/components/ExpeditionCard.tsx
  ```

### 2. Add Variant Support
- Add a required `variant` prop:
  ```ts
  variant: 'jungle' | 'standard'
  ```
- Use this to determine visual structure (color palette, badges, layout style)

### 3. Support Core Props
- Each ExpeditionCard must support:
  - `title: string`
  - `description: string`
  - `completedAt: Date | string`
  - `xpEarned: number`
  - `category?: string`
  - `icon?: string`
  - `variant: 'jungle' | 'standard'`
  - `className?: string`

### 4. Theme Logic
- Jungle variant may show decorative elements (leaf icons, jungle badge, vine borders)
- Standard variant should remain minimal and clean
- Use Tailwind + `cn()` utility for conditional styling

### 5. Remove All Redundant Copies
- Delete all other `ExpeditionCard` files after refactor
- Update all references across the app to point to the new version

---

## ❌ YOU MAY NOT:

- Fork the component for each theme
- Add state logic (this is a display-only card)
- Create XP logic here — just render the data
- Create new assets or icon libraries without permission

---

## ✅ DELIVERABLE:
One component:
```ts
client/src/components/ExpeditionCard.tsx
```

It must render completed quests (expeditions) in a visually styled card that adapts to the selected theme. This card is strictly for historical display of user accomplishments.

---

## SUMMARY:
This is a display-only card designed to show completed quests. You’re consolidating it to ensure clean layout, consistent XP visuals, and a future-proofed theme system. The Jungle variant can be styled richly; the standard variant must remain clean and professional.
