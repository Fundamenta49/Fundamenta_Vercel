# ✅ Bundle 5 QA Checklist – Testing, Rate Limiting, and Hardening

This checklist ensures the stability, performance, and protection of the platform before public release.

---

## 1. Rate Limiting and Abuse Prevention
- [ ] Sensitive API endpoints (e.g., `/api/assignments`, `/api/pathways`) are rate-limited
- [ ] Throttle repeated POST/PATCH/DELETE requests
- [ ] Public access endpoints (e.g., `/api/pathways?public=true`) have read-only rate limits
- [ ] Bot activity prevention (basic protection)

---

## 2. Permissions & Access Control
- [ ] Students can only view their own assignments
- [ ] Mentors can only view/manage students they are connected to
- [ ] Public pathways are not editable unless created by the current user
- [ ] Unauthorized access attempts return 403/401 errors with no sensitive data

---

## 3. Error Handling & Fallbacks
- [ ] All API endpoints return structured JSON error responses
- [ ] Frontend displays helpful user messages on:
  - 403 (Access denied)
  - 404 (Not found)
  - 500 (Unexpected server error)
- [ ] Graceful fallback UI for:
  - No assignments
  - No public pathways
  - API errors or network failures

---

## 4. Load Testing (Manual/Simulated)
- [ ] Simulate 100+ concurrent users assigning pathways
- [ ] Confirm response times stay below 300ms for key endpoints
- [ ] Confirm DB connections remain stable under load

---

## 5. Code Quality & Linting
- [ ] ESLint/Prettier pass on all frontend and backend files
- [ ] No unused imports or variables
- [ ] No console warnings in browser or Node logs

---

## 6. Session Security
- [ ] Sessions use secure, HTTP-only cookies
- [ ] Session expiration is defined and enforced
- [ ] JWT payloads don’t expose sensitive user info

---

## 7. Mobile + Accessibility
- [ ] JungleHub and PublicPathways views display properly on mobile
- [ ] Tab navigation works for all buttons/controls
- [ ] ARIA labels present on interactive components

---

## 8. Deployment Readiness
- [ ] Routes are correctly registered in App.tsx
- [ ] Theme toggles persist across refresh
- [ ] All jungle assets (icons, styles) are properly bundled

---

Once these checks are complete, the platform is ready for staging or beta release.
