Introduction: The Growing Knowledge Gap in Life Skills
Despite the rise of digital education tools, there remains a substantial gap in accessible,
structured life skills education. Many people struggle with financial literacy, emergency
preparedness, career readiness, and overall well-being due to inadequate educational
resources, socio-economic barriers, and the lack of a centralized solution.
The Reality of Unpreparedness:
 Emergency Response Deficiency:
o Only 54% of U.S. adults report knowing how to perform CPR. (American
Heart Association, 2023)
o 70% of bystanders feel helpless during emergencies due to lack of
knowledge. (Red Cross Survey, 2022)

 Financial Literacy Crisis:

o 57% of Americans are financially illiterate, struggling with debt, credit
management, and budgeting. (National Financial Educators Council,
2023)
o Lack of financial literacy costs Americans $1,819 per person annually.
(NFEC, 2022)
 Job Readiness Issues:
o Over 40% of employers say recent graduates lack essential soft skills like
communication, problem-solving, and adaptability. (National Association of
Colleges and Employers, 2023)
 Mental Health Accessibility:
o 1 in 4 adults in the U.S. has an untreated mental health condition due to
barriers in accessibility, cost, or awareness. (National Institute of Mental
Health, 2023)

 Wellness &amp; Preventative Care Gaps:
o Poor nutrition, lack of physical activity, and mental health neglect
contribute to chronic illnesses and decreased quality of life. (CDC, 2023)
o Limited access to structured wellness education prevents individuals from
maintaining long-term health and resilience.
