# Fundamenta ActiveYou Section Enhancement Project

## Project Overview

We are redesigning the ActiveYou section of the Fundamenta platform to transform the exercise components (HIIT, Yoga, Running, Weightlifting, Stretching, Meditation) from multi-tabbed cards into sophisticated standalone applications.

### Platform Context
Fundamenta is a holistic life skills platform that integrates:
- Life Skills Education (finance, home maintenance, cooking)
- Wellness & Health (including the ActiveYou section)
- Career Development (resume building, career guidance)
- Mental Health Support (mindfulness practices, stress management)

Our enhancements must maintain integration with:
1. **Existing Learning Pathways** - Preserving connection to structured learning progression
2. **Arcade Integration** - Maintaining links to gamification elements
3. **Wellness Journal System** - Using a unified journaling approach rather than component-specific journals

## Current Progress

### Completed:
- Created stretch-specific-exercises-enhanced.tsx
- Created running-specific-exercises-enhanced.tsx 
- Created weightlifting-specific-exercises-enhanced.tsx
- Created meditation-specific-exercises-enhanced.tsx
- Fixed integration with section-fallbacks.ts for video fallbacks

### In Progress:
- Revising meditation-specific-exercises-enhanced.tsx to integrate with platform's unified journaling system
- Ensuring all components maintain connectivity with learning pathways and arcade elements

## Current Focus: Meditation Component Revision

We're currently focused on enhancing the meditation component by:

1. **Removing redundant journal functionality** - Instead of a separate meditation journal, we'll integrate with the platform's existing wellness journal by:
   - Adding a post-meditation prompt with Fundi suggesting journal entry creation
   - Pre-populating journal entries with meditation-specific details
   - Tagging entries as "meditation" within the main journal system
   - Displaying meditation-tagged entries from the main journal

2. **Maintaining pathway/arcade integration** - Ensuring our enhanced component:
   - Preserves API hooks that learning pathways depend on
   - Maintains consistent progress tracking for learning pathways and arcade
   - Keeps proper implementation of gamification triggers
   - Preserves activity identifiers for platform recognition

3. **Enhancing meditation functionality** - Focus on unique features:
   - AI-guided meditation using OpenAI integration
   - Timer with customizable duration
   - Ambient sound selection
   - Dark mode for better relaxation
   - Integration with the platform's existing journaling system
   - Insights generated from meditation history

## Design Principles

Throughout this work, we're adhering to these principles:

1. **Platform Cohesion** - Maintain consistent design language and integration with platform systems
2. **Avoid Redundancy** - No duplicate functionality; leverage existing platform systems
3. **Enhanced Experiences** - Create richer, more immersive standalone experiences for each exercise type
4. **Learning Continuity** - Preserve connections to learning pathways and progression tracking
5. **Gamification Support** - Maintain integration with arcade and achievement systems

## Next Steps

1. Revise meditation component to replace journal tab with integration to main journal system
2. Add Fundi prompt after meditation completion to suggest journal entry
3. Test integration with existing learning pathways
4. Ensure all standalone exercise components maintain consistent design language
5. Verify arcade connections are preserved

## Implementation Details

Each exercise module is implemented as a standalone React component with:
- Base UI structure from enhanced-exercise-card.tsx
- Exercise-specific functionality (e.g., GPS for running, guided sessions for meditation)
- OpenAI integration for AI-guided experiences
- Connection to platform journaling system
- Learning pathway and arcade hooks maintained

### Meditation Component Structure
- Practice tab: AI-guided meditation with timer, ambient sounds, dark mode
- Insights tab: Analytics from meditation-tagged journal entries
- Integration: Post-session Fundi prompt to create journal entry
