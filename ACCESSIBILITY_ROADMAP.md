# Fundamenta Accessibility Roadmap

This document outlines planned enhancements to make Fundamenta more accessible to diverse users including neurodivergent individuals, those with ADHD, and users with various learning styles - all while preserving Fundi's core identity and functionality.

## Core Philosophy

Fundamenta's approach to accessibility is based on:

1. **AI-Driven Adaptation**: Let Fundi automatically detect and adapt to user needs, rather than requiring explicit configuration
2. **Universal Design**: Create features that benefit all users, not just those with specific needs
3. **Progressive Enhancement**: Implement improvements that don't disrupt core functionality
4. **Implicit Learning**: Allow Fundi to learn from user interactions rather than explicit settings

## Near-Term Implementations (1-3 months)

### Voice Interaction Using Web Speech API

**Goal**: Add basic voice input/output capabilities to enhance accessibility

**Implementation Steps**:
1. Add speech recognition via the Web Speech API
   - Integrate microphone button in chat interface
   - Convert speech to text for processing by Fundi
   - Handle permissions and browser compatibility

2. Add speech synthesis for Fundi's responses
   - Implement text-to-speech for Fundi's messages
   - Add options to control voice speed/pitch
   - Ensure proper handling of specialized vocabulary

3. Provide visual indicators during voice interaction
   - Show when system is listening
   - Provide transcript of recognized speech
   - Allow easy correction of misrecognized words

**Technical Considerations**:
- Requires browser support (Chrome, Edge, Safari)
- Works best on desktop but functional on modern mobile browsers
- No additional API costs as it uses native browser capabilities

### Attention-Aware Interface Enhancements

**Goal**: Adapt to varying attention spans without explicit configuration

**Implementation Ideas**:
1. Track task completion patterns to identify optimal content chunk size
2. Implement subtle progress indicators for longer activities
3. Add automatic bookmarking to remember where users left off
4. Create natural break points in longer content sequences

## Medium-Term Goals (3-6 months)

### Interaction Pattern Analysis

**Goal**: Have Fundi learn how each user best processes information

**Implementation Ideas**:
1. Track which content formats (text, visual, interactive) generate most engagement
2. Monitor session duration patterns to identify optimal learning periods
3. Analyze question patterns to identify comprehension challenges
4. Gradually adjust content presentation based on observed patterns

### Multiple Content Format System

**Goal**: Present the same information in different ways based on user preferences

**Implementation Ideas**:
1. Create content storage system that supports multiple representations
2. Develop UI components that can switch between formats
3. Implement preference tracking to identify which formats work best
4. Allow smooth transitions between formats

## Long-Term Vision (6+ months)

### Advanced Voice Interaction

**Goal**: Implement high-quality voice interaction comparable to smart assistants

**Implementation Options**:
1. OpenAI Whisper API for improved speech recognition
2. Amazon Polly or Google Cloud Text-to-Speech for natural-sounding voices
3. Custom wake word detection for a more assistant-like experience

### Cognitive Load Detection

**Goal**: Detect when users are overwhelmed and adapt automatically

**Implementation Ideas**:
1. Analyze response times and patterns to identify cognitive load
2. Implement dynamic difficulty adjustment based on detected patterns
3. Create subtle visual indications of system adaptation

### Fully Adaptive Learning Pathways

**Goal**: Completely personalized learning experiences based on user patterns

**Implementation Ideas**:
1. Create branching content paths that adapt to user strengths/challenges
2. Implement learning style detection through interaction patterns
3. Develop dynamic gamification that adjusts challenge levels automatically

## Implementation Guidelines

1. **Cardinal Rule**: Never damage Fundi's core functionality
2. **Testing Protocol**: Test all accessibility enhancements with a diverse user group
3. **Prioritization**: Focus on implicit adaptations before explicit configurability
4. **Documentation**: Document all adaptation mechanisms for future enhancement
