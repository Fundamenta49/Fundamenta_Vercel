# Tour Authentication Fix

## Issue

The application had an issue where the tour would automatically start before checking authentication status, causing users to see a blank screen with only the tour dialog when first accessing the deployed application.

## Root Cause

1. The tour initialization in `client/src/contexts/tour-context.tsx` was happening immediately upon component mount, without waiting to verify if:
   - Authentication had finished loading
   - The user was actually authenticated

2. This resulted in the tour attempting to navigate to protected routes before authentication was verified, leaving users on a blank screen with only the tour component visible.

## Fix Implemented

The solution modifies the tour initialization process to:

1. **Wait for authentication to complete**: Now the tour only initializes after the auth loading state is complete
2. **Check authentication status**: The tour only starts for authenticated users, not for unauthenticated visitors
3. **Proper sequencing**: Authentication checks now happen before any tour-related navigation

### Code Changes

Modified in `client/src/contexts/tour-context.tsx`:

```typescript
// Import auth context to check authentication status
const { isAuthenticated, loading: authLoading } = useAuth();

// Check if the user has seen the tour before and load user name,
// but only after authentication is checked and user is authenticated
useEffect(() => {
  // Wait until auth is no longer loading
  if (authLoading) {
    return; // Exit early if auth is still loading
  }
  
  // Only check tour state if the user is authenticated
  if (isAuthenticated) {
    // Check if tour has been seen
    const tourSeen = localStorage.getItem('hasSeenTour');
    if (tourSeen) {
      setHasSeenTour(true);
    } else {
      // Start tour automatically on first visit, but only for authenticated users
      startTour();
    }
    
    // Check if user name is stored
    const savedUserName = localStorage.getItem('tourUserName');
    if (savedUserName) {
      setUserName(savedUserName);
    }
  }
}, [isAuthenticated, authLoading]);
```

## Result

- Users now see the login page immediately when accessing the deployed application
- The tour only starts after successful login and authentication
- No more blank screen with just the tour component floating in empty space
- The application follows a proper authentication flow before initializing user experiences

## Best Practices for Components Using Authentication

1. Always check authentication status before initializing features that require authentication
2. Use a loading state to prevent premature rendering when auth status is uncertain
3. Conditionally show features only after authentication is confirmed
4. Avoid automatic redirects or tour launches before checking auth status
