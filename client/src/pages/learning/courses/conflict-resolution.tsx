            Conflict is a natural part of human interaction. Understanding the nature of conflict is the first 
            step to resolving it effectively. This module explores what conflict is, why it occurs, and how 
            it can actually lead to positive outcomes when handled appropriately.

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">What is Conflict?</h3>
          <p>
            Conflict is a disagreement or struggle between people with opposing needs, ideas, beliefs, values, 
            or goals. It can range from minor disagreements to serious disputes that damage relationships.

            <li><strong>Scarce Resources:</strong> Competition for limited time, money, space, or attention</li>

              Conflict itself isn't necessarily negative—it's how we handle conflict that determines whether the 
              outcome is destructive or constructive. Productive conflict can lead to better solutions, stronger 
              relationships, and personal growth.

            Communication is at the heart of conflict resolution. How we express ourselves and listen to others 
            can either escalate or de-escalate conflicts. This module covers essential communication skills for

          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">Active Listening</h3>
          <p>
            Active listening means fully concentrating on what the other person is saying rather than just passively 
            hearing. It involves:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li>Giving your full attention without planning your response while they speak</li>
            <li>Showing you're listening through body language (eye contact, nodding)</li>
            <li>Paraphrasing to confirm understanding ("What I hear you saying is...")</li>
            <li>Asking clarifying questions to gather more information</li>
            <li>Acknowledging emotions ("I can see this is really frustrating for you")</li>

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li>Facial expressions (maintain a neutral or open expression)</li>
            <li>Body posture (uncrossed arms, facing the person)</li>
            <li>Tone of voice (calm, measured speech)</li>
            <li>Eye contact (engaged but not intimidating)</li>
            <li>Personal space (respectful distance)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <h3 className="text-lg font-semibold mt-6">De-escalation Techniques</h3>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li>Speak slowly and calmly, even if the other person is not</li>
            <li>Lower your volume rather than raising it</li>
            <li>Take deep breaths to manage your own emotions</li>

            Sometimes the wisest approach is to recognize when a conflict can't be resolved immediately:

          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li>When safety is at risk (physical or psychological)</li>
            <li>When one party is unwilling to engage in good faith</li>
            <li>When the timing is wrong (e.g., during crisis or extreme stress)</li>
            <li>When professional help is needed (counselor, mediator, lawyer)</li>
          </ul>
          
          <div className="p-4 bg-purple-50 rounded-md mt-6">
            <h4 className="font-medium text-purple-800">Wisdom Note</h4>
            <p className="text-purple-800">
              Not all conflicts need to be resolved immediately. Sometimes setting the issue aside temporarily 
              or agreeing to disagree respectfully is the best approach. Choose your battles wisely.
