                    correctAnswer: 1,
                    explanation: "Regular replacement of HVAC filters improves system efficiency (saving energy costs), extends the life of your HVAC system, and improves indoor air quality by removing dust, allergens, and other particles."

                    explanation: "Smoke and carbon monoxide detectors should be tested monthly to ensure they're working properly. Batteries should be replaced at least once a year, and the entire units should be replaced according to the manufacturer's recommendations (usually every 10 years for smoke detectors and 5-7 years for carbon monoxide detectors)."

                    correctAnswer: 1,
                    explanation: "Grease, oils, and food particles are the most common causes of kitchen drain clogs. They can build up over time, especially if hot grease is poured down the drain where it solidifies as it cools."

                    correctAnswer: 1,
                    explanation: "Gutters should typically be cleaned twice a year - in late spring and early fall. However, if you have many trees near your home, you might need to clean them more frequently. Clogged gutters can lead to water damage to your roof, siding, and foundation."

                    options: [
                      "Call a plumber immediately",

                    correctAnswer: 1,
                    explanation: "The first step when dealing with any plumbing leak is to stop the water flow by turning off the water supply to that fixture. This prevents further water damage while you assess the situation and either fix it yourself or call a professional."

                    correctAnswer: 2,
                    explanation: "For most climates in the United States, the Department of Energy recommends attic insulation with an R-value of R-38 to R-60, which typically equates to about 10-14 inches of fiberglass batt insulation or more. This helps maintain energy efficiency year-round."

                      "The water supply line",
                      "The flush valve (flapper)",

                    correctAnswer: 1,
                    explanation: "A continuously running toilet is most commonly caused by a faulty flush valve (flapper) that isn't sealing properly. Check if it's worn, misaligned, or if the chain is preventing it from seating correctly. This is typically an easy and inexpensive fix."

                    correctAnswer: 1,
                    explanation: "In typical climates, exterior house paint should be refreshed approximately every 5-7 years. However, this can vary significantly based on climate, sun exposure, paint quality, and home construction. More severe weather conditions may require more frequent painting."

                      "Leave the can open to dry out before disposal",
                      "Store in the original can with the lid tightly sealed, in a temperature-controlled environment",
                      "Transfer to plastic containers for better sealing",
                      "It cannot be stored once opened and must be used immediately"
                    ],
                    correctAnswer: 1,
                    explanation: "For longest shelf life, store paint in its original can with the lid tightly sealed. Clean the rim of the can before closing to ensure a good seal. Store in a temperature-controlled environment (not too hot or cold) and away from direct sunlight. Properly stored latex paint can last 2-10 years."

                      "To improve air circulation",

                    correctAnswer: 1,
                    explanation: "A sump pump's primary purpose is to prevent water damage in basements by collecting water in a sump pit and pumping it away from the foundation. This is especially important in areas with high water tables or frequent heavy rainfall that could otherwise lead to basement flooding."
