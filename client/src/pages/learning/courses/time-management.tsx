            Time is our most limited resource. Effective time management isn't about squeezing more tasks 
            into your day—it's about getting the right things done, making the most of your time, and maintaining 
            a healthy work-life balance.

            <li>Create more time for things you enjoy</li>

            Effective time management begins with your mindset. Developing these mental habits can transform your productivity:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Value your time:</strong> Recognize time as a finite, non-renewable resource</li>
            <li><strong>Be intentional:</strong> Make conscious choices about how you spend your time</li>
            <li><strong>Focus on outcomes:</strong> Measure productivity by results, not hours worked</li>
            <li><strong>Embrace imperfection:</strong> Accept that "good enough" is sometimes appropriate</li>
            <li><strong>Practice patience:</strong> Time management is a skill that improves with practice</li>

              The goal of time management isn't to become a productivity machine—it's to create a balanced

          <p>
            This principle suggests that roughly 80% of results come from 20% of efforts. In time management, this means:
          </p>
          <ul className="list-disc pl-5 space-y-2">
            <li>Identify the 20% of your tasks that produce 80% of your desired outcomes</li>

            <li>Minimize time spent on low-value activities that contribute little to your goals</li>

            <li><strong>A:</strong> Must do — Serious consequences if not completed</li>
            <li><strong>B:</strong> Should do — Mild consequences if not completed</li>
            <li><strong>C:</strong> Nice to do — No consequences if not completed</li>
            <li><strong>D:</strong> Delegate — Tasks someone else can do</li>
            <li><strong>E:</strong> Eliminate — Tasks that aren't necessary</li>

            <p className="text-yellow-800">
              A common mistake is confusing urgency with importance. Just because something feels urgent
