                <h4 className="font-medium text-base">Identify Your Needs</h4>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                  Consider what specific issues you'd like help with and what type of therapy might be most 
                  beneficial. Different therapists specialize in different approaches and issues.

                <h4 className="font-medium text-base">Check Your Insurance Coverage</h4>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                  If you have health insurance, check which mental health services are covered and if there's 
                  a list of in-network providers. This can significantly reduce your out-of-pocket costs.

                <h4 className="font-medium text-base">Research Potential Therapists</h4>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                  Look for therapists with experience in your specific concerns. Check their credentials, 
                  training, and approach to therapy. Many therapists list this information on their websites 
                  or professional profiles.

                <h4 className="font-medium text-base">Consider Practical Factors</h4>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                  Think about location, session availability, fees, and whether the therapist offers 
                  in-person or virtual sessions. These practical considerations can affect your ability 
                  to consistently attend therapy.

                <h4 className="font-medium text-base">Schedule Initial Consultations</h4>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                  Many therapists offer brief initial consultations, often for free or at a reduced rate. 
                  This gives you a chance to assess whether you feel comfortable with the therapist and 
                  their approach.

              <div>
                <h4 className="font-medium text-base">Assess the Fit</h4>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                  After your first session or two, reflect on how you feel about the therapist. Do you feel 
                  understood and respected? Is their approach aligning with your needs? Trust is essential 
                  in the therapeutic relationship.
