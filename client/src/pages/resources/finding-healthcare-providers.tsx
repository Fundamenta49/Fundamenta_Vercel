            A good relationship with your primary care physician is essential for maintaining your health and 
            addressing medical concerns. Finding the right doctor requires considering factors like 
            qualifications, compatibility, and practical considerations.

                <h4 className="font-medium text-base">Check Your Insurance Network</h4>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                  Start by reviewing which doctors are in-network with your health insurance to maximize 
                  your benefits and minimize out-of-pocket costs. Most insurance providers offer 
                  online directories of in-network physicians.

                <h4 className="font-medium text-base">Consider Doctor Specialties</h4>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                  Primary care physicians may be family practitioners, internists, or general practitioners. 
                  Family doctors treat patients of all ages, internists focus on adult medicine, and pediatricians 
                  specialize in children's health.

              <div>
                <h4 className="font-medium text-base">Check Credentials and Experience</h4>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                  Verify that the doctor is board-certified in their specialty, which indicates they have 
                  the necessary training and have passed specialty exams. Online resources like the American 
                  Board of Medical Specialties can help verify credentials.

                <h4 className="font-medium text-base">Research Hospital Affiliations</h4>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                  Consider which hospitals the doctor is affiliated with. This matters if you need specialized 
                  care or hospitalization, as you'll likely be referred within their hospital network.

              <div>
                <h4 className="font-medium text-base">Consider Practical Factors</h4>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                  Think about office location, hours, telemedicine options, and how long it typically 
                  takes to get an appointment. These practical considerations can significantly impact 
                  your healthcare experience.

                <h4 className="font-medium text-base">Read Reviews and Ask for Recommendations</h4>
                <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                  Ask friends, family, and other healthcare providers for recommendations. Online reviews 
                  can provide insights, but remember they represent individual experiences.

                <p className="text-sm text-gray-600">
                  Meet with the doctor to assess your comfort with their communication style, 
                  whether they listen carefully, and if they take time to answer your questions.

            <ul className="ml-8 list-disc space-y-2 text-amber-700">
              <li>Consider any specific health needs you have and whether the doctor has experience in those areas</li>
              <li>If you have chronic conditions, you may want a doctor who specializes in those conditions</li>
              <li>For those with mobility issues, check if the office is accessible</li>
              <li>If English is not your first language, consider whether the doctor or staff speaks your preferred language</li>

          <h3>Questions to Ask a New Doctor</h3>

            <li>How can I reach you or the on-call doctor after hours?</li>
            <li>Which hospitals are you affiliated with?</li>
            <li>How long does it typically take to get an appointment?</li>
            <li>Do you offer telemedicine services?</li>
            <li>What is your approach to preventive care?</li>
            <li>How do you handle referrals to specialists?</li>
            <li>What are your views on [specific health concern you have]?</li>
