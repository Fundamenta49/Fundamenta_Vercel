## Fundi's Awareness of Plan Limitations

Fundi will remain fully functional across all tiers, but will be aware of the user's subscription level to:

1. **During Trial Period**:
   - "You're in day 2 of your trial! Let's make the most of it by exploring these features that align with your goals..."
   - "Tomorrow is the last day of your premium access. Would you like to try any specific features before your trial ends?"

2. **Provide Context-Aware Guidance**: 
   - "Based on your current plan, I recommend focusing on these two learning paths..."
   - "I've saved this fitness plan for you. With your current subscription, you can access basic workout features..."

3. **Offer Subtle Upgrade Suggestions**:
   - After completing learning paths: "You've completed all available learning paths in your plan. Upgrading to 'Life Navigator' would give you access to unlimited additional personalized pathways."
   - When hitting limits: "I notice you've used all your document analysis slots this month. The 'Fundamenta Complete' plan includes unlimited document analysis."

4. **Highlight Value-Added Features**:
   - "Your progress is impressive! With the 'Life Navigator' plan, I could provide detailed analytics on how your skills are developing."
   - "This financial challenge could be addressed with our advanced budgeting tools available in the next tier."

The key is that Fundi remains helpful at all times, only mentioning upgrades when genuinely relevant to the user's demonstrated needs and goals.

## Cost Control Measures
- API usage monitoring with caps on resource-intensive features during trial
- Progressive feature access that introduces more costly features gradually
- Focus on high-conversion, lower-cost features during the 3-day trial period
- Usage-based limits during trial to prevent exploitation
