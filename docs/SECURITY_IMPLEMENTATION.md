# Fundamenta Security Implementation Guide

## Bundle 5A: Security Fundamentals

This document outlines the security enhancements implemented in Bundle 5A, focusing on Permission & Access Control, Error Handling & Fallbacks, and Session Security.

### 1. Authentication & Session Security

We've implemented a robust authentication system with the following features:

- **HTTP-Only Cookies**: Replaced localStorage tokens with secure HTTP-only cookies for authentication
- **Token Refresh Mechanism**: Added automatic token refresh to maintain user sessions securely
- **Secure Cookie Options**: Implemented strict same-site policy and secure flags for production
- **Session Expiration**: Set appropriate expiration times (4 hours for access tokens, 7 days for refresh tokens)
- **Automatic Database Session Cleanup**: Implemented scheduled cleanup of expired and duplicate sessions

### 2. Role-Based Access Control

A hierarchical role-based access control system has been implemented:

- **User Roles**: Defined clear role hierarchy (user → student → parent/teacher → admin)
- **Permission Middleware**: Created middleware functions for validating user permissions
- **Role-Specific Routes**: Protected sensitive routes with role requirements
- **Hierarchical Access**: Higher-level roles automatically have access to lower-level permissions

### 3. Standardized Error Handling

We've created a comprehensive error handling system:

- **Custom Error Classes**: Defined specific error types for different scenarios (AuthenticationError, AuthorizationError, etc.)
- **Consistent Response Format**: All API endpoints now return errors in a consistent format
- **Appropriate HTTP Status Codes**: Utilized proper status codes for different error scenarios
- **Informative Error Messages**: Created user-friendly error messages without exposing sensitive information

### 4. Rate Limiting Protection

To protect against potential abuse:

- **API Rate Limiting**: Implemented rate limiting on authentication endpoints and sensitive operations
- **IP-Based Limiting**: Added IP-based rate limiting for unauthenticated requests
- **User-Based Limiting**: Implemented user-based rate limiting for authenticated requests
- **Graduated Response**: Implemented escalating cooldown periods for repeated violations

### 5. Database Security

Enhanced database security through:

- **Parameterized Queries**: All database operations use parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection
- **Type Safety**: Added TypeScript type safety throughout database operations
- **Minimal Data Access**: Implemented principle of least privilege in database queries
- **Database Maintenance**: Added scheduled maintenance tasks for data integrity

### Implementation Notes

- The authentication middleware is defined in `server/auth/auth-middleware.ts`
- Error handling utilities are located in `server/utils/errors.js`
- Rate limiting functions are in `server/utils/rate-limiter.js`
- Database security is implemented through Drizzle ORM's structured query builders

### Next Steps (Bundles 5B & 5C)

- **Bundle 5B (Performance & Quality)**: Will focus on performance optimization, caching, and code quality improvements
- **Bundle 5C (User Experience & Deployment)**: Will address user experience enhancements and deployment optimizations
