# Fundamenta Security Implementation

## Bundle 5A: Security Fundamentals Implementation

The Bundle 5A security enhancement focuses on three core areas:

1. **Permissions & Access Control**
2. **Error Handling & Fallbacks**
3. **Session Security**

This document outlines the implementation details for these security enhancements.

## 1. Permissions & Access Control

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

We've implemented a hierarchical role-based access control system with the following roles:

- **User**: Regular platform users with basic permissions
- **Mentor**: Can access student information and track progress
- **Admin**: Can manage users, pathways, and access administrative tools
- **Super Admin**: Has unrestricted access to all platform features

The permissions system is defined in `server/utils/permissions.js` and provides:

- Clear permission definitions for each resource type
- Role inheritance hierarchy
- Permission checking utilities
- Resource ownership verification

### Implementation Files:
- `server/utils/permissions.js`: Core permission definitions and checking functions
- `server/auth/auth-middleware.ts`: Authentication and authorization middleware

### Key Security Features:
- **Permission Checks**: All sensitive operations verify user permissions before execution
- **Resource Ownership**: Users can only modify their own resources unless they have elevated permissions
- **Role Hierarchy**: Permissions inherit from lower roles to higher roles
- **Granular Permissions**: Fine-grained control over specific actions on resources

## 2. Error Handling & Fallbacks

### Standardized Error Handling

We've implemented a comprehensive error handling framework that:

- Provides explicit error types for different error scenarios
- Standardizes error response formats across all API endpoints
- Includes appropriate HTTP status codes
- Prevents sensitive information leakage in production

### Rate Limiting Protection

To prevent abuse and potential denial-of-service attacks, we've implemented rate limiting:

- **IP-based Rate Limiting**: Prevents excessive requests from any single IP address
- **User-based Rate Limiting**: Limits API requests per authenticated user
- **Stricter Limits for Sensitive Endpoints**: More restrictive limits for authentication endpoints
- **Exponential Backoff**: Increasing penalties for repeated violations

### Implementation Files:
- `server/utils/errors.js`: Custom error classes and error handling utility
- `server/middleware/error-handler.js`: Express middleware for centralized error handling
- `server/utils/rate-limiter.js`: Rate limiting middleware implementation

### Key Security Features:
- **Consistent Error Responses**: All API errors follow a standardized format
- **Custom Error Types**: Specific error types for different scenarios
- **Rate Limiting Headers**: Response headers with rate limit information
- **Development vs. Production**: Different error detail levels based on environment

## 3. Session Security

### Secure Authentication

We've improved the authentication system with:

- **HTTP-Only Cookies**: JWT tokens stored in secure HTTP-only cookies instead of localStorage
- **Token Refresh Mechanism**: Automatic token refresh without requiring re-authentication
- **Secure Cookie Options**: Secure flags and same-site settings on all cookies
- **CSRF Protection**: Cross-Site Request Forgery protection measures

### Secure Headers

Security headers are set for all responses:

- **Content-Security-Policy**: Restricts resource loading to prevent XSS attacks
- **X-Content-Type-Options**: Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-XSS-Protection**: Additional XSS protection for older browsers
- **Referrer-Policy**: Controls referrer information in requests

### Implementation Files:
- `server/auth/auth-middleware.ts`: Secure cookie handling and JWT implementation
- `server/routes.ts`: Security headers and middleware setup

### Key Security Features:
- **Secure Cookies**: HTTP-only, secure cookies with appropriate expiration
- **Token-based Auth**: JWT implementation with proper signing and verification
- **Automatic Token Refresh**: Seamless token renewal for better user experience

## Testing and Verification

A test script is provided to verify the security implementation:

- `server/test-security.js`: Tests error handling and rate limiting functionality

Run this script to ensure the security features are working as expected.

## Further Security Recommendations

- **Regular Security Audits**: Schedule periodic code reviews focused on security
- **Dependency Scanning**: Use tools to scan for vulnerable dependencies
- **Security Training**: Ensure developers are trained on secure coding practices
- **Penetration Testing**: Conduct regular penetration tests to identify vulnerabilities

These security enhancements significantly improve the application's security posture. Bundles 5B and 5C will build on this foundation with additional performance, quality, and user experience improvements.
