## Usage Guidelines

### Best Practices for AI Interaction

1. **Be Specific**: Precise questions yield better results than vague queries
2. **Provide Context**: Include relevant details for more accurate responses
3. **Use Natural Language**: The system understands conversational queries
4. **Domain-Specific Queries**: Mentioning the domain (finance, fitness, etc.) improves routing
5. **Follow-Up Questions**: Reference previous queries for continuity
6. **Emotional Context**: The system adapts to emotional states, so expressing needs clearly helps

### Optimization Techniques

1. **Brevity**: Concise queries use fewer tokens and receive faster responses
2. **Batch Related Questions**: Combine related inquiries in a single message
3. **Specialized Features**: Use purpose-built features for specific tasks rather than general queries
4. **Contextual Continuity**: Maintain conversation threads for better context
5. **Feature Utilization**: Take advantage of tier-specific features

### System Limitations

1. **Time-Sensitive Data**: The system may not have the latest information beyond its training data
2. **Complex Mathematical Calculations**: While basic math is supported, complex calculations may have errors
3. **Highly Technical Domains**: Specialized technical knowledge may be limited in some areas
4. **Ambiguous Queries**: Vague or ambiguous questions may yield generic responses
5. **Very Long Contexts**: Extremely long conversation histories may lose earlier context

## System Behavior Under Different Conditions

### API Status Scenarios

| Scenario | System Behavior | User Experience | Recovery |
|----------|----------------|-----------------|----------|
| **API Fully Operational** | Optimal performance across all features | Full capabilities, fast responses | N/A |
| **API Degraded Performance** | Slightly increased response times, potential retry logic | Minor delays, full feature set | Automatic as API performance improves |
| **API Rate Limiting** | Queuing of requests, prioritization by tier | Tier-based response times, possible delays | Automatic as rate limits reset |
| **API Temporary Outage** | Fallback to alternative providers | Limited feature set, pattern-based responses | Automatic when primary API returns |
| **API Extended Outage** | Cache-based responses, severely limited features | Basic functionality preserved, advanced features unavailable | Manual system reset once API available |

### Content-Related Behaviors

| Content Type | System Handling | Performance Expectation |
