# Strategy Consolidation Notice

**Date: May 3, 2025**

## Important Changes to Strategy Documentation

As of May 3, 2025, we have consolidated and updated our strategy documentation to better align with our mission of avoiding the common pitfalls that have affected other life skills platforms.

### New Strategy Documents

1. **[Fundamenta Success Blueprint](FUNDAMENTA_SUCCESS_BLUEPRINT.md)**
   - Core strategy to avoid common life skills platform failures
   - Prioritized implementation plan with clear timelines
   - Integrated monetization analysis

2. **[Consolidated Strategy 2025](CONSOLIDATED_STRATEGY_2025.md)**
   - Comprehensive approach integrating all strategic elements
   - Combines success blueprint, monetization framework, and accessibility goals
   - Supersedes previous strategy documents

### Archived Documents

The following documents have been archived and should no longer be referenced for current development:

- **USER_RETENTION_STRATEGY.md** (now archived)
- **CONVERSION_STRATEGY.md** (now archived)

These documents can be found in the [archived_strategies](archived_strategies/) directory for historical reference.

### Accessibility Roadmap

The **ACCESSIBILITY_ROADMAP.md** remains active and should be considered alongside the new strategy documents, as its principles have been integrated into our consolidated approach.

## Implementation

Development teams should now reference the Consolidated Strategy 2025 document as the primary source of strategic direction, with the Success Blueprint providing detailed guidance on specific implementation priorities.
