# Bundle 5B: Performance & Quality Plan

## Overview
Bundle 5B focuses on optimizing application performance, implementing caching strategies, and improving code quality to ensure the application runs efficiently and is maintainable long-term.

## Implementation Areas

### 1. Response Caching
- Implement in-memory caching for frequently accessed data
- Add Redis-compatible caching layer for distributed environments
- Set up smart cache invalidation strategies for data consistency

### 2. API Performance
- Optimize database queries to reduce response times
- Implement pagination for large data sets
- Add query result memoization for repeated requests
- Compress API responses

### 3. Frontend Performance
- Implement code splitting for JavaScript bundles
- Add lazy loading for components and routes
- Optimize React component rendering and state management
- Optimize images and static assets

### 4. Database Optimization
- Add indexes for frequently queried fields
- Implement query optimization and batching
- Add connection pooling improvements
- Set up database-level caching strategies

### 5. Code Quality
- Implement structured error logging
- Add performance monitoring and analytics
- Improve test coverage for critical paths
- Refactor duplicated code and improve organization

### 6. User Experience Optimizations
- Add loading states and skeleton screens
- Implement background data fetching
- Add prefetching for anticipated user journeys
