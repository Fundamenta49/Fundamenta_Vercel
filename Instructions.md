# Fundamenta Life Skills Platform - Deployment Fix Plan

## Current Status Assessment

After thorough analysis of the codebase, we've identified several areas that need to be addressed for successful deployment. The application runs well in development but encounters issues in production environments.

## 1. TypeScript Build Process

### Issues:
- The current build process uses Vite for the frontend and esbuild for the backend
- The build output directories may not match expected paths in production
- Module format inconsistencies between development and production

### Solutions:
- ✅ Verify TypeScript configuration in tsconfig.json
- ✅ Enhanced build script to handle both frontend and backend properly
- ✅ Ensured consistent module resolution between environments
- ✅ Created specialized production server entry point

## 2. Environment Variables

### Issues:
- Environment variables correctly set in development may be missing in production
- Critical API keys not properly propagated to production environment
- DATABASE_URL handling in different environments is inconsistent

### Solutions:
- ✅ Documented all required environment variables
- ✅ Created robust environment variable validation on startup
- ✅ Enhanced DATABASE_URL handling with fallback options
- ✅ Added health check log messages to identify missing variables

## 3. Client-Side Assets

### Issues:
- Static file serving configuration not optimized for production
- Cache headers may be missing for improved performance
- Client-side routing not properly handled for deep links

### Solutions:
- ✅ Enhanced static file serving with proper cache headers
- ✅ Implemented SPA fallback to index.html for client-side routing
- ✅ Added multiple fallback paths to find client build directory
- ✅ Improved content security policy for production

## 4. Health Check System

### Issues:
- Health check endpoints not compatible with cloud platforms
- Missing handlers for specialized health check user agents
- Health endpoint response format inconsistencies

### Solutions:
- ✅ Implemented unified health check system
- ✅ Added support for multiple health check paths and request patterns
- ✅ Enhanced detection of health check requests from cloud platforms
- ✅ Standardized health response format to `{"status":"ok"}`

## 5. Containerization

### Issues:
- Docker configuration may not properly build both frontend and backend
- Production server not optimized for containerized environments
- Health check not properly configured for container orchestration

### Solutions:
- ✅ Created optimized Dockerfile for CloudRun/Kubernetes deployment
- ✅ Added specialized production server configuration
- ✅ Enhanced server to bind to all network interfaces (0.0.0.0)
- ✅ Configured proper signal handling (SIGTERM, SIGINT) for graceful shutdown

## 6. Deployment Options

We've prepared multiple deployment options to ensure flexibility:

1. **Replit Deployment**
   - Use `node deployment/replit-deployment.js` to prepare configuration
   - Click Deploy button in Replit interface

2. **Docker/CloudRun Deployment**
   - Build with `docker build -f deployment/cloudrun.Dockerfile -t fundamenta-app .`
   - Deploy container to preferred cloud platform

3. **Traditional Node.js Deployment**
   - Build with `npm run build`
   - Start with `NODE_ENV=production node deployment/production-server.js`

## Deployment Pre-Flight Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:

- [ ] All required environment variables are set in your deployment environment
- [ ] Database connection has been tested with `node deploy-validation.js`
- [ ] Health checks pass with `node deployment/verify-health.js`
- [ ] Build completes successfully with `npm run build`
- [ ] Static assets are properly included in the build

## Post-Deployment Verification

After deployment, verify:

1. The application responds correctly at the deployment URL
2. The `/health` endpoint returns `{"status":"ok"}`
3. API endpoints respond as expected
4. Client-side routing works for deep links
5. External API integrations function correctly

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Health Check Failures
- Verify the health endpoint is accessible
- Ensure correct port configuration
- Check for firewall or network restrictions

### Missing Static Assets
- Verify the build process completed successfully
- Check the static file paths in the deployment logs
- Ensure the static directory is properly configured

### Database Connection Issues
- Verify DATABASE_URL is correctly set
- Check for network connectivity to the database
- Ensure database migration has been run

### API Integration Failures
- Verify all required API keys are set
- Check API health monitoring logs
- Test individual API endpoints for detailed errors
